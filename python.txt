some definition of a Instance Variable:
a variable declare within a class but outside any method that holds values specific to instance of that class. 



instance means a object type and we can create multiple instance of this object type

* object is an instance of a class .it represents a specific implementation of a class and holds its own data .


self is a reference key word
* self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class.it allows us to access the attributes and methods of the object.

* CLASS  in python a way to structure and organize code into reusable components. They facilities code reusability ,modularity and maintainability by capsulating data and method within objects.

object is a tangible entity that represents a particular instance of a class.it combines data and behaviors specified by the class


*** a class is a user define prototype or blueprint from which object are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together .

**__init__ method is called when a new instance of the class is created ,this method serves as the constructor for the class and initializes the objects attributes .
